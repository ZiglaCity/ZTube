# ZTube is the short form of Zigla's YouTube Downloader. It is a desktop application fully built in python, which allows users to search for youtube videos either using the url of the video or by using the title or keyword of the video. It allows the user to select the video to be download and specify the desired resolution and file size and also change the location where the video is to be saved.
